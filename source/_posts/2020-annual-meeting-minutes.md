### Minute of the QVHA Annual Meeting - August 15, 2020

The meeting was called to order at 10:15am on Saturday, August 15, 2020 at 27 Snead Drive, Mashpee, MA. In attendance were:

-   Tony Venuti
-   Gary Johnson
-   Dave Fravel
-   Christopher Nelson
-   Ed Markowski

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the Board voted to cancel the standard, in-person annual meeting. Instead, we sent the instructions, 2021 budget, 2019 actual income & expenses, and voting form to the community via email, website, and personal delivery. We requested that homeowners either mail or drop-off their voting forms by Thursday, August 13.

As of Saturday, August 15, 64 homes submitted their voting forms. This number was verified by Board President Tony Venuti, and Board Secretary Dave Fravel. The response exceeded the quorum requirement of 25% of the community needed to approve the annual meeting agenda items.

### Budget Vote

By a vote of 64-0, the 2021 budget was passed.

### Board Member Vote

By a vote of 64-0, the 2020-2021 Board was elected. However, there was one vote against a specific member of the board. One homeowner voted against Dave Fravel continuing on the Board because he’s no longer a member of the Association. He moved to Cotuit in January.

This led to a discussion and a review of the by-laws. The by-laws state:

**Article 7. Board of Directors**  
The affairs of the Association shall be managed by a board of not less than (3) nor more than five (5) directors, none of whom need be members of the Association.

Based on this, it was determined that Dave Fravel could continue to serve as a member of the QVHA Board.

### Board Roles

With the unanimous vote to approve the 2020-2021 QVHA Board, the following roles have been assigned:

-   President - Tony Venuti
-   Treasurer - Gary Johnson
-   Secretary - Dave Fravel
-   Landscape Liaison - Ed Markowski
-   Director - Christopher Nelson

### Budget Discussion

With the unanimous approval of the 2021 budget we had a brief discussion about categorizing landscape expenses.

Going forward, all general landscape maintenance and Ball Landscaping expenses will come out of the $10,000 landscape maintenance line item. Any extra work (e.g. tree work, new signs) will come out of the $5000 “site improvements” line item. For 2020 we had been classifying flower purchases and other small-ticket items as “site improvements.” Going forward, these will be considered landscape maintenance.

### Sign Discussion

The Sign Sub-Committee continues to gather information and pricing for three new signs - one for each of the entrances at Hogan, Palmer and Snead. It was hoped that the sub-committee would have been able to complete this research and present at the annual meeting, but schedules didn’t line up.

When the sub-committee is ready to make a recommendation to the Board, the Board will schedule a meeting.

As a reminder - the sign sub-committee was created after the 2019 annual meeting when there was enough interest shown in researching new options.

### Trailers and Trucks

We have received some complaints about commercial vehicles and trailers parked in driveways within the Association.

The by-laws address **_habitable_** trailers (which are not allowed), but does not specifically address other types. The Board encourages members to minimize the parking of commercial vehicles and trailers on their property.

### Assessment Letters and 2020 Collections

There are still 8 homes in the neighborhood that have not paid their 2020 assessments. Dave Fravel will be sending them letters (possibly registered letters) requesting payment ASAP. If there is no response, the Board will file legal liens on the properties.

For 2021, we’ll be sending assessment letters by the end of September with a return date of January 1.

### New Business Discussion

Christopher Nelson updated the board on his discussions to bring OpenCape into the Association. At this time, the cost would be about \$2000 per home. The conversation has been tabled.

### New Community Members

Over the past few months, we’ve had homes purchased at:

-   6 Hogan
-   17 Player
-   56 Palmer
-   91 Palmer
-   262 Old Barnstable

In the past, a member of the Board has been tasked with welcoming new members to the Association. Over the past few years this formal practice has faded away. Ed Markowski mentioned that his wife, Carolyn Markowski, would be interested in renewing this process. Based on this, Dave Fravel will be printing copies of the by-laws and the QVHA Public Directory for Carolyn to use when welcoming new members. If any members of QVHA is interested in working with Carolyn, please contact the Board at <board@qvhamashpee.com>

The meeting adjourned at 10:59am.
