### Background Information

At the 2019 QVHA Annual Meeting, a number of homeowners suggested that we review the condition of the entry signage at Palmer, Hogan, and Snead. A committee was formed to evaluate the condition of the signs and recommend a plan of action. The committee included Don Allen, Chair, Martha Cosgrove, Martha Johnson and Bob Mollenhauer.

Over the past several months they have taken photos of every sign showing the damage of each. They have met with three different sign companies to discuss design, specifications, and cost. Don constructed full scale mock ups of the 3 different sign designs. The committee met recently to approve a design and select a firm to construct and install the signs.

### The Decision

The 2020 budget includes an approved $5000 for improvements to the community. The Board has approved an expenditure of $5028.13 for the construction and installation of three new signs.

### Supporting Documentation

Here's a [link to the supporting documentation](/assets/files/qvha-sign-documentation.pdf) that guided us in the decision:

-   photos of the existing signs showing some rot
-   photos of the selected sign design
-   a spreadsheet of the bids received
-   the proposal from Kiwi Signs & Marine Graphics of Falmouth, the selected contractor.
