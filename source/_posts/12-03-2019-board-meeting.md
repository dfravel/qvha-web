### Minute of the QVHA Board Meeting - Tuesday, December 3, 2019

The December board meeting was held from 7pm-8:15pm at 27 Snead Drive.

#### In Attendance

-   Tony Venuti
-   Janice Mercadante
-   Dave Fravel
-   Gary Johnson
-   Christopher Nelson

#### Financial Review

Janice was in attendance at the start of the meeting to complete the bookkeeping handoff from her to Gary Johnson. Gary will be managing all of the QVHA finances from this point forward. This includes paying our monthly expenses (only a few invoices each month) and generating the quarterly reports.

It was decided that we will be canceling our Quickbooks Online account. There isn’t enough activity to warrant a system as complex as QBO.

#### Landscaping RFP Response Review

We received two responses to the request for proposals for the landscaping service. Tony will be discussing the proposals with the two vendors - both responses left room for interpretation and didn’t completely answer our requirements.

#### Assessment Status

To date, we have received 19 assessment payments. Tony will be depositing these in the Cape Cod 5 operating account this week.

#### Holiday Party Status

To date, there are 57 individuals who will be attending the holiday party. Dave’s reminder email that was sent on Tuesday afternoon generated 4 emails from others who are planning to attend but haven’t RSVPd yet. Tony will be depositing the latest round of checks into the Cape Cod 5 Social Committee account this week

#### Covenants

The remainder of the meeting was spent discussing the covenants and the continued complaints from residents about boats, trailers, and cars parked overnight on the road. As a reminder, the covenants state that:

-   boats may not be visibly stored on properties
-   habitable trailers may not be visibly stored on properties
-   cars may not be parked on the street overnight (however, the official time period isn’t clearly stated.)

Based on our reading of the by-laws there is no indication that a penalty can be assessed for infractions. In addition, changing the by-laws is an arduous and expensive process that could take years to complete and would require LaCava’s approval.

One option that was discussed, but tabled for now, was hiring a lawyer to read through the existing by-laws to see if there are any simpler options.

For now, we agreed that Tony will be sending a message to homeowners who are in violation of the covenants reminding them of the by-laws for the HOA.

**Meeting was adjourned at 8:15pm**
