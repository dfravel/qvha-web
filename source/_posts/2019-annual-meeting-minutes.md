### Minute of the QVHA Annual Meeting - August 17, 2019

The meeting was called to order at 10am by Board President Tony Venuti. Christopher Nelson and Dave Fravel joined Tony at the front of the room to present.

Prior to the meeting copies of the agenda and financials were made available to all members of the community. At the meeting an updated directory was available to all attendees.

53 homes were represented at the meeting, based on a review of minutes from previous years, this may have been our largest gathering.

### Pledge of Allegiance and Reflection

Tony Cocuzzo led us in the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silent reflection to honor those members of the community no longer with us

### New Community Members

Dave Fravel called out the addresses that have been bought/sold during the past year. Two new households were represented at the meeting - the Barnums (84 Palmer) and the Rakutis’ of 122 Snead (still under construction). Over the past year there have been at least 8 home sales in the neighborhood.

### Technology Investment and New Website

Christopher Nelson demoed the new qvhamashpee.com website, and asked everyone to review it and offer suggestions for ways that it could become a better resource for the community.

Christopher also reviewed the investment that the board has made with Office365 accounts. This allows us to have separate email addresses attached to board positions (no longer using personal email accounts) as well as a cloud-based storage for all of our documentation such as: by-laws, certificates of no lien, meeting minutes, directories, and financial reports.

### Landscape Committee

Tony Venuti began his report on the Landscape Committee by recognizing Gary Corrigan for all of the hard work that he did through the second half of 2018. Gary C was responsible for kick-starting the Landscape Committee and implementing all of the ideas (area captains, regular meetings, shared responsibilities) that have been carried through 2019. The baton has been passed to a growing number of homeowners with Ed and Carolyn Markowski playing a leadership role.

Ed Markowski has arranged for estimates for tree work within the common areas. Since it’s a challenge to get a “tree-guy”, Ed asked that if anyone is interested in having any tree work done on their property that they should contact him to coordinate an estimate. Ed can be reached at ecmarkowski@hotmail.com.

### Sunshine Committee

Tony Venuti honored the memory of Dottie Hiltz for her efforts in leading the Sunshine Committee. With Dottie’s passing the Board has assumed control of the \$1374 remaining in the Sunshine Committee bank account. This is managed on a separate ledger and is not mingled in with the QVHA budget. Tony asked for a volunteer to lead the Sunshine Committee going forward. Later in the meeting Joanne Coletti volunteered her services. A signup sheet was made available for those interested in helping Joanne and 5 other homeowners offered to help.

### Closing the books on 2018

Tony Venuti reviewed the final numbers from 2018. The information is available in the powerpoint presentation that will be included with these minutes.

### 2019 Financials to Date

Tony Venuti reviewed the current financials through July 31. The information is available in the powerpoint presentation that will be included with these minutes. There are 3 households that have not paid their 2019 assessments. These homes have been mailed a lien notification for non-payment.

### 2020 Budget

Tony Venuti reviewed the budget for 2020 which is essentially the same as it was for 2019. The board recommends that we maintain the current assessment level of \$200 to cover the budgeted items and build up a small cushion for catastrophes such as the tornado that hit Yarmouth and Harwich.

Bruce Willard made a motion to vote on the budget. It was seconded by at least a dozen voices. The vote was unanimous to approve the 2020 budget.

### Yard Sale Discussion

We decided to table the vote for a community-wide yard sale after multiple people raised questions about whether or not this would require a by-law change. If it’s a by-law change that requires a full year and a ⅔ vote. If people are looking to get rid of old items within their homes it was suggested that they contact Big Brothers Big Sisters or Habitat for Humanity. Both organizations will come to your home for pickups.

### Open Forum

Some items that came up during an open discussion period:

-   We have a signage sub-committee that’s looking into modernizing the HOA signs at the main entrances
-   Brian Cosgrove asked for a round of applause for Ed and Carolyn Markowski for all they’ve done for the common area landscaping
-   The Site Improvement Committee (formerly landscape committee) will be putting together an RFP and soliciting proposals from (hopefully) three companies for landscape services in the common area for next year
-   Gary Johnson asked for a round of applause for Gary Corrigan for all the work that Gary did over the past year.
-   Gary Johnson also thanked Agnes Bolduc for her donation of all the cobblestones for the common areas
-   There was a general discussion about boats, trailers, unregistered cars, advertising signs, and other possible by-law and covenant infractions. The board has promised to address these matters.

### Board Member Vote

The Board for 2019-2020 will be:

-   Tony Venuti - President
-   Christopher Nelson - Treasurer
-   Dave Fravel - Secretary
-   Gary Johnson

The vote to approve the board was unanimous

The meeting adjourned at 10:55am.
