A recent topic of conversation was ownership of the roads within the HOA. I moved here in 2013 and never knew the full story for how the town came to take ownership of the roads so I asked Tony V to document the history. Here's what he shared:

```
The cost to QVHA homeowners was a total of 264,172.  The cost was equally divided by homeowners of record at the time at 2291.30.

The vote to transfer was approved by over 80% of the community.  The driving force was the condition of the roadways, catch basins etc.  Prior to the transfer QVHA had a reserve fund for road maintenance.  The amount of money in reserves was used to supplement operational requirements.

At last years Annual Meeting the Board and Community voted to increase dues to $200 to continue to maintain a reserve for unanticipated events such as a severe storm that could knock over trees on common land or other such events.

Since the roads are now monitored by the police, I suspect that parking on the street might now come under town control.
```

Here's [a document](/assets/files/qvha-road-transfer.pdf) that summarizes the transaction relative to the taking of the roads by the Town of Mashpee, Article 20 of Town Meeting of May 2, 2010.

We hope this clears up any confusion that may exist about the status of the roads. If you have any questions please send us a [message](/contact).
