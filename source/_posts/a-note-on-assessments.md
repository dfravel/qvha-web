title: A Note on Annual Assessments

description: Annual Assessments are due by January 31. We are only mailing letters to those who don't have email addresses

We're trying something different this year. We're not mailing assessment notices to every household. We're only mailing assessment notices to homes that don't have an email address in our directory.

We're doing this for a few reasons:

-   printing and mailing the assessments to all homes costs over \$75. That seems like a waste of our budget.
-   for the most part, we all know about the assessments. It shouldn't be a surprise that we pay them each year.
-   Honestly, we've been too busy to take the time to fold, stuff, label, and mail all of the envelopes. It's a tedious process.

We hope everyone understands the reason for this change. If you have any questions please send us a [message](/contact).
